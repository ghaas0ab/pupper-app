# Cost Optimization Strategies

## DynamoDB
- Using auto-scaling to adjust capacity based on demand
- Consider using DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) for frequently accessed data

## Lambda
- Set appropriate memory allocation (512MB is a good starting point)
- Use provisioned concurrency for predictable workloads
- Set log retention to reduce storage costs

## API Gateway
- Use caching to reduce Lambda invocations
- Consider using API Gateway usage plans and throttling

## S3
- Set lifecycle policies to transition older objects to cheaper storage classes
- Enable compression for stored objects

## CloudWatch
- Set appropriate log retention periods
- Use metric filters to extract only necessary data

## General
- Use AWS Cost Explorer to identify cost-saving opportunities
- Set up AWS Budgets to monitor and alert on spending
- Consider using Savings Plans or Reserved Instances for predictable workloads
